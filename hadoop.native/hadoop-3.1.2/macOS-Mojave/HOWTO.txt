Install Packages with Homebrew for OS X
	https://brew.sh/

Pre-requisites

Ensure JDK 8 is installed. (Compilation with JDK 8 below update 12 will not pass - See HADOOP-14900)

gcc
GNU Autools Chain: autoconf, automake, libtool
cmake
snappy
gzip
bzip2
protobuf (use this: homebrew/versions/protobuf250)
zlib
openssl


brew install <library/package-name>
brew install gcc autoconf automake libtool cmake snappy gzip bzip2 zlib openssl

Note: homebrew/versions is deprecated so protobuf250 needs to be compiled or installed as binary

git clone https://github.com/apache/hadoop.git
cd hadoop
git checkout branch-3.1.2

Manually edit the following file:
hadoop/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/native/container-executor/impl/utils/docker-util.c

Add (int *) to the following line at two places in the file
getgrouplist(user, pw->pw_gid, groups, &ngroups)

getgrouplist(user, pw->pw_gid, (int *)groups, &ngroups)


See explanation
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-8622

Compile using (Remember to correctly set JAVA_HOME and OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR)
OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2r (replace the path to the applicable path)
mvn package -Pnative  -DskipTests -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR -Dtar

You could check if hadoop is using native libraries by invoking the following command
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop checknative -a
